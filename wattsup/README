This is a slightly modified version of the watts up tool that
they offer on their website. (https://www.wattsupmeters.com/secure/index.php)
And (https://www.wattsupmeters.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=1;sa=showPosts)

This software works with the particular model of the Watts up Pro we have,
there's no guarantee it will work with yours.

To run the code, use something like this:
   wattsup ttyUSB0

Use "dmesg" after plugging in the device to see what the USB serial
port is detected at.

If running Ubuntu, the brltty Braile reading device might be interfering.
Try removing it if the log indicates that is what is happening.
