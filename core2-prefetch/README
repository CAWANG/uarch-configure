This is	a program I wrote to disable hardware prefetch using
mtrrs on Core2 processors on Linux.

It in theory only works	on Core2 machines (note: it will not work
on Nehalem, it will not	work on	AMD machines).

I wrote	this when trying to figure out the effect of the hardware
prefetcher on L1 dcache	hit rates using	perf counters. 	Running
this program sometimes (but not	always) changed	the results.  So
use at your own	risk.

This code is based on code from msr-tools-1.2
   http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/cpu/msr-tools/
by H. Peter Anvin.

This code depends on /dev/msr support being enabled in your kernel.
You might need to run the included 
   MAKEDEV-cpuid-msr
program first.
