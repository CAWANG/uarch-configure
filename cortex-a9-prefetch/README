This code tries to disable the L2 HW prefetching on ARM Cortex A9
machines on the fly with a module.

It locks/panics the machine a lot of the time.  And when it doesn't,
something in the kernel gets stuck and eats 40% of the CPU and sucks
down a watt of power.

In the end for the experiments it was easier to just disable the
prefetch at boot-time. See the included patch against 3.8.0.
