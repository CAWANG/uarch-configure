This code tries to disable architectural features on the Raspberry Pi 2
(armv7 Cortex A7).

This is a lot harder than on the original Raspberry Pi, as the
armv6 1176 chip in the original Pis did not have secure mode ("TrustZone").

On the pi2, the bootloader switches the pi into non-secure mode before
launching the kernel.  The kernel itself does not care about this, in fact
it possibly depends on running in nonsecure mode.

It does mean that the various registers that are disabled and/or
shadowed/mirrored in nonsecure mode are not accessible to us anymore.
And this includes the various disabling registers.


Note that on Cortex-A7 you cannot disable branch prediction if the MMU is
active.
