This is a kernel module that will change the branch prediction
method being used by an R12k MIPS processor.  This has been
extensively tested on an Octane2 machine running Linux 2.6.22
with the speedracer and perfmon patches applied.

The proper way to do things would be to have a command-line parameter
that sets the mode.  For now, you have to edit the source and recompile.

This requires a functioning Linux kernel source tree, plus either
a compiler or cross compiler.
